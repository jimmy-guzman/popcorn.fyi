## Overview

Popcorn.fyi uses **GitHub Actions** to manage continuous integration workflows and **Vercel** for automatic deployments. The pipeline is designed to catch issues early, automate routine tasks like dependency updates and PR labeling, and deploy only after all checks pass.

---

## Key Components

1. **CI Workflow:** Runs on PRs and `main` branch. Performs:
   - Format check, linting, type checking
   - Unit/component tests (Vitest)
   - E2E tests (Playwright)
   - Coverage reporting (Codecov)

2. **CD Workflow:** Triggered by merges to `main`:
   - Re-runs CI checks
   - Deploys to Vercel

3. **PR Labeling:** Uses path-based rules to auto-tag PRs (e.g., `lib:ui`, `app:web`).

4. **Dependabot Automation:**
   - Auto-approves and merges when all checks pass

5. **Caching:**
   - Restores `pnpm` install cache
   - Uses **TurboRepo remote cache** to speed up builds and tasks

## Workflow Details

### CI Trigger

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]
```

### CD Trigger

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
```

CI always runs before deploys, ensuring no skipped validations.
